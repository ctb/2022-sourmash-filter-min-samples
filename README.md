# 2022-sourmash-filter-min-samples

Usage:
```
./filter-min-samples.py *.sig -o filtered.zip
```

Note: if you output to a zip file, you can use `sourmash sig split` to
break them into individual files again. Alternatively, use a directory
(ending with `/`) to save them as individual signature files directly.
